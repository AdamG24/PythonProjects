    "Splitting the respondents by gender yielded similar rankings results, as both genders tended to rank the original trilogy better. The only exception to that is that females actually ranked Episode 1 (PT) higher than Episode 4 (OT). In general, the PT was ranked higher with females. However, what was interesting about that was that when calculating the number of respondents who had seen the movies, males actually had seen the prequel trilogy more than females. So even though the males had seen the Prequel Trilogy more than the females, they still rated it lower then women who on averaged ranked the prequel trilogies higher."
